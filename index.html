        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        
        <p>I am a 17 year old High School graduate that has been studying from home since age 3. My formation ranges from traditional books to very specific courses selected to build my future. Every year I have been given a list of books to read, separate projects, trips and courses that I have taken voluntarily for my own personal growth, these vary from classics like Little Women all the way to important historical texts, like the Odyssey. My curriculum has been crafted carefully to broaden my working frame, flexibility and adaptability, but at the same time curated a reference frame that will serve the next stage of my schooling.
        </p>

        On these last few weeks I have been working on my college applications, studying for the SAT and the TOEFL, I plan on taking them next year, starting on March. And after I plan on studying Criminal Justice or Criminology.
